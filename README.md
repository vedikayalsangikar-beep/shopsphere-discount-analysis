**Shopsphere: E-commerce Analytics Case Study Series**

This repository contains a multi-part analytics case study exploring how pricing and customer behavior influence business outcomes in a simulated e-commerce platform.

Each model in the series focuses on a distinct business question and applies SQL, Python, and Tableau to analyze data, surface insights, and communicate results clearly.  
The intent is to demonstrate structured analytical thinking, not just tool usage.

**Model Index**

**Model 1: Do Discounts Really Drive Revenue?**

Focus: Order-level revenue performance  

Question: Do discounts meaningfully increase revenue, or do they erode value despite higher order volumes?

- Transaction-level SQL analysis  
- Python-based regression modelling  
- Tableau dashboard for revenue trends  
- Output: One-page case study + dashboard

**Model 2: Do Discounts Improve Customer Retention?**
Focus: Customer-level behavior and long-term value  
Question: Do discounted customers return more often and contribute higher lifetime revenue?

- Customer-level feature engineering in SQL  
- Retention and engagement analysis in Python  
- Tableau dashboard for repeat behavior and value  
- Output: One-page case study + dashboard
